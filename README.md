# cropsy

> Image Cropper prototype built with Ember, Yeoman, and Foundation.

## Getting Started

This app was build using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), the Web's scaffolding tool. The Yeoman workflow combines three tools:

1. Yo
2. Grunt
3. Bower

To get started, clone this repository and ````cd```` into your newly created directory:

```shell
cd cropsy
```

This prototype requires that you have Yeoman installed. To do so, run:

```shell
npm install -g yo
```

Install the neccessary gem dependancies:

```shell
bundle install
```

Install Bower dependancies:

```shell
bower install
```

Lastly, install the Node dependancies:

```shell
npm install
```

To start your server run:

```shell
grunt serve
```
